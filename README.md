I have tested this website multiple times and am confident the site works well.  
### What Works
- Simple for the user to understand.
- All links work.
- No need for the browser back button.
- Responsive for all devices
    - Some images are hidden on mobile devices and everything is resized proportionally.
- Tested multiple user stories with no issues.

### Testing User Stories
Example:
  
1. Fan looking for media:
    1. Locate the media from the navbar (each link will bring you to the desired section of the media page).
    2. Locate the media from the gallery section of the homepage (each link will bring you to the desired section of the media page).
    3. Listen to audio in the footer of the website.
    
This testing has been done for all user stories.

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
